The installation of the JavaBACI classes was successful.

To make the JavaBACI applications easier to use,
the installation program has stored a script
named 'javabaci.bat' in the directory

      C:\Users\Danny Le\Desktop\baci\Cross Platform\JavaBACI\scripts

To use this script, you have to place it in one of
the directories in your PATH expression.  Type 'PATH'
in a CommandPrompt window to list these directories.

After you have done this, to have the JavaBACI 'bagui' PCODE
interpreter execute the 'c-increment.pco' PCODE file, type

       javabaci.bat bagui c-increment

Using 'javabaci.bat' to invoke the other JavaBACI applications
'bacc', 'bapas', 'badis', 'bainterp', 'baar' and 'bald'
is similar.

Please look over the README and sample programs in the
sample_programs directory.

This dialog will be stored in the file ExtractionDialog.txt
in the directory C:\Users\Danny Le\Desktop\baci\Cross Platform\JavaBACI.
