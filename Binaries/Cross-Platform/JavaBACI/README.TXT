Keep in mind that ./JavaBACI is just what ./JavaBACIclasses-2007Nov08.jar will spit out once you run it.

From the old BACI website:

"The BACI system can now execute in Java. JavaBACI consists of all BACI applications, including the C and Pascal compilers, disassembler, archiver, linker, and command-line and GUI PCODE interpreters. The input, behavior, and output of programs in JavaBACI are identical to the input, behavior, and output of programs in the original BACI system (our C implementation of BACI). In JavaBACI, one continues to write concurrency programs in C-- or Pascal (not Java). JavaBACI will execute on any computer that has an installation of the Java Virtual Machine. Specifically, users need the Java Runtime Environment (java 1.5.0 or higher).

To use JavaBACI, download the JavaBACI Classes. To extract the JavaBACI system, double click on the file or type java -jar JavaBACIclasses-2007Nov08.jar. To execute, browse into the scripts directory and type javabaci xxx (or javabaci.bat xxx on a CYGWIN or Windows machine), where xxx is one of the original BACI commands (e.g., bacc, bapas, bainterp, etc.).

If you would like to view or modify the JavaBACI source code, download the JavaBACI source code file. Users need the Java Development Kit (javac 1.5.0 or higher) to use the JavaBACI source code. The JavaBACI source code contains all the JavaBACI classes; thus, if you only view the code (not modify it), recompilation of JavaBACI is not required."
