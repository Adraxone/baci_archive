# BACI Archive

This repository is an archive of **BACI (Ben-Ari Concurrent Interpreter)** binaries, collected for preservation and convenience. It includes command-line versions, GUI front-ends, and full implementations in Java.

> **Note:** This is not a new tool—just an archive of existing BACI binaries. Despite testing them, I cannot promise any of these will work under any circumstances.

## Contents

- `./Binaries/` — Main collection of BACI binaries
- `./Binaries/Cross-Platform/` — Includes:
  - GUI front-ends for `bainterp`
  - Java-based implementations of BACI  
  ⚠️ **Note:** The BACI GUI is *not* the latest version of BACI.

## Usage

To download the archive:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adraxone/baci_archive
```
